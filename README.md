# SDG_assessment_FeliX

This version of the FeliX model was used in a research paper ("A robust, integrated policy portfolio is necessary to promote global progress across multiple sustainable development goals") submitted to The Lancet Planetary Health.

FeliX (Functional Enviro-economic Linkages Integrated neXus) is a system dynamics model of global social, economic, and environmental Earth systems. More information can be found at: https://iiasa.ac.at/models-tools-data/felix Different versions of the FeliX model used in various publications and a full documentation of the model can be found at: https://github.com/iiasa/Felix-Model

The model is developed on the modelling software Vensim, therefore the users should have Vensim installed to be able to display and simulate the model. This version of the FeliX model requires features that are available only in the licensed version, which is Vensim DSS. The users who have no access to Vensim DSS can still display the model by using the Vensim Model Reader.
